### About me

I am a Software Engineer at HelloFresh Canada and a Computer Science graduate from Queen's University. I'm a curious person, striving to learn the ins and outs of various technologies and domains in the industry.

I'm experienced in backend software development, DevOps technologies and practices such as CI/CD, infrastructure development, and developer tooling, and agile methodologies. I strive to communicate my expertise clearly and confidently, sharing my experiences with others in hopes of developing each other's skills together.

I'm originally from Israel but I moved to Toronto, Canada, with my family in late 2004. Canada is a different life than Israel, but they're both amazing countries in their own way 🇮🇱 🇨🇦

### A little overview

- 📦 I'm currently working on SCM (Supply Chain Management) Tech in HelloFresh Canada, based out of Toronto, creating tools and infrastructure for distribution centers
- ⚙️ I spend my day with `Python` and various `AWS` services, building out a solution using serverless technologies such as **AWS Lambda**, **RDS**, **Cognito**, and a plethora of **EC2** services
    - I have previous experience with microservice technologies like `Docker`, `Kubernetes` and `Openshift`
    - I also manage and maintain our CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions on a daily basis, constantly finding new ways to improve the developer experience and reduce the time we spent doing repetitive tasks
- 🧠 I've previously worked at IBM as a Cloud & Cognitive Software Developer Intern working on [Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps][waiops]
- 💬 Ask me about my job, my history, my interests, or anything you can think of 😎
- 📫 Reach me via [email][email], [LinkedIn][linkedin] or even [Twitter!][twitter]
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube, not that quickly, but I learned in just under 24 hours!
